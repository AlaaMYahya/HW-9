## Flutter UI Implementation Guide:

**Review the provided UI design in Figma and replicate it using Flutter widgets, ensuring to match layout, colors, typography, and interactive elements. Customize styles, handle interactivity, and ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes. Test thoroughly and refine as needed, documenting your process. Capture screenshots of your implementation and include them in the README file to showcase your work. Finally, celebrate your success in successfully implementing the UI in Flutter!**
